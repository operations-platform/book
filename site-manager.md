# Site Manager

Site Manager is a Drupal module that provides a CMS for your websites.

In addition to URLs, Site Manager stores properties about the site such as Last Cron, Install Time, PHP and Drupal Versions.

Site Manager has an API that allows it to receive site entities from remote sites.

This means that any Drupal site, running anywhere, can post information about itself back to any Site Manager instance, including sites running in CI or behind firewalls.
